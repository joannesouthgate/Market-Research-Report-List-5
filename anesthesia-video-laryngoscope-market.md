<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anesthesia video laryngoscope market is categorized into channelled and un-channelled video laryngoscopes. Channelled video laryngoscopes feature a built-in channel that allows for the passage of endotracheal tubes or other instruments, facilitating intubation in complex cases. Un-channelled video laryngoscopes, on the other hand, do not have this channel, making them simpler in design but still effective for visualizing the airway. Both types enhance intubation success rates and provide better visualization for anesthesiologists during procedures.</p></p>
