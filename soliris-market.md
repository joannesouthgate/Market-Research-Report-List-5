<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soliris Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plasma Exchange</li><li>Plasma Infusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soliris operates in the market segments of plasma exchange and plasma infusion, both critical for treating certain rare blood disorders. Plasma exchange involves removing the patient's plasma and replacing it with donor plasma or a substitute to reduce harmful substances in the blood. In contrast, plasma infusion entails administering donor plasma directly into the patient to restore essential proteins. These two methods complement Soliris's therapeutic applications, enhancing patient outcomes by addressing underlying conditions effectively.</p></p>
