<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The renal dialysis machines market includes two primary types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis machines filter blood through an artificial kidney, providing efficient clearance of waste and toxins, generally conducted in a clinic or at home. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis employs the patient's abdominal lining as a natural filter, using a dialysis solution to absorb waste, and is often performed at home. Both methods are essential for managing end-stage renal disease and cater to different patient needs and lifestyles.</p></p>
