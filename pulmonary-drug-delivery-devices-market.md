<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulmonary Drug Delivery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Powder Inhaler</li><li>Metered Dose Inhaler</li><li>Nebulizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pulmonary drug delivery devices market includes three main types: dry powder inhalers (DPIs), metered dose inhalers (MDIs), and nebulizers. DPIs deliver medication in powdered form, requiring patients to inhale deeply to achieve proper dosing. MDIs provide aerosolized medication via a pressurized canister, delivering a metered dose with each actuation. Nebulizers convert liquid medication into a mist for inhalation, making them suitable for patients unable to use other devices, particularly in delivering larger doses or multiple medications simultaneously.</p></p>
