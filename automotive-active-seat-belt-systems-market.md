<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Active Seat Belt Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Emergency Locking Retractor</li><li>Automatic Locking Retractor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Active Seat Belt Systems market primarily features two types: Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) and Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR). ELR allows the seat belt to extend freely under normal conditions but locks during sudden stops or collisions, ensuring passenger safety. In contrast, ALR locks the seat belt in place when pulled fully out, securing child seats or preventing unwanted movement. Both systems enhance passenger protection by adapting to driving conditions, ultimately contributing to overall vehicle safety standards.</p></p>
