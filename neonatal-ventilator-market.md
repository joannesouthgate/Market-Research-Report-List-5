<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neonatal ventilator market can be divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require intubation, delivering breath directly into the lungs, making them suitable for critically ill infants who need close respiratory support. In contrast, non-invasive ventilators utilize methods like nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to aid breathing without intubation. Non-invasive options are often preferred for less severe cases, promoting comfort and reducing the risk of complications.</p></p>
