<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Cardiac Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li><li>Biological/Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial cardiac valves market consists of several types, including mechanical heart valves, biological or tissue heart valves, and transcatheter heart valves. Mechanical heart valves are durable and designed for long-term use but require blood-thinning medication. Biological heart valves, made from animal or human tissue, offer a more natural option but may need replacement after 10-15 years. Transcatheter heart valves allow minimally invasive implantation, ideal for high-risk patients, enhancing treatment options and recovery times in heart valve disease management.</p></p>
