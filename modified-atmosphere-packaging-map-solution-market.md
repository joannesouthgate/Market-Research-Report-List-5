<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Packaging</li><li>Passive Packing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) solutions enhance food preservation by altering the atmospheric composition within the packaging. Active packaging actively interacts with the packaged food, using substances that absorb gases, emit antimicrobial agents, or regulate humidity, thus enhancing shelf life and freshness. In contrast, passive packaging relies on creating a modified atmosphere without active components, primarily by controlling gas concentrations. Both methods aim to extend the longevity of food products while maintaining quality and safety, catering to varying consumer needs.</p></p>
