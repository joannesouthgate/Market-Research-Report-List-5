<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>'Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensor'</li><li>'Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensor'</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car tire pressure monitoring sensor market is categorized into two main types: Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensors (TPMS) and Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensors. Direct TPMS utilizes sensors mounted on each tire that measure the air pressure directly, providing real-time data and alerts when pressure is low. In contrast, Indirect TPMS does not have dedicated sensors; it estimates tire pressure by monitoring tire rotation rates through the vehicle's ABS system, providing less precise but cost-effective solutions.</p></p>
