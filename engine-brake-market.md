<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Engine Brake market includes Compression Release Brakes and Exhaust Brakes, both used to slow vehicles by controlling engine power. Compression Release Brakes work by releasing compressed air in the engine cylinders, creating resistance to slow the vehicle. Exhaust Brakes restrict exhaust flow, increasing backpressure to reduce speed. Compression Release Brakes are more efficient for heavy-duty vehicles, while Exhaust Brakes are simpler and cost-effective for lighter applications. Both systems enhance braking efficiency, reduce wear on traditional brakes, and improve safety in downhill or heavy-load scenarios.</p></p>
